# Shortcuts *beta*#

Adds a suite of shortcuts to OS X. To install download the `.zip` from [harrybeadle.co.uk](http://harrybeadle.co.uk/Shortcuts/index.html) and follow the instructions in `InstallHelp.md`.

## Notes and Future Features ##

 - If, for any reason, the service fails you will be presented with an error message. Normally this is because of the application itself and not the services. If the application is throwing errors in all applications try re-installing the services.
 
 - In some cases your own keyboard shortcuts just plain wont work. Our recommendation is that you use `Ctrl-Alt-Cmd` and `Arrow Keys` for your shortcuts, as these ones worked for us.
 
 - In the future there will be an install package that will automatically set the shortcuts, along with more services.
 
## Troubleshooting ##

Your shortcuts are probably the problem. Try going to the application menu (on the top left of your screen, next to the apple logo.) and then selecting services and then clicking on one of our services. If this doesn't work, then re-install. If it works, try changing your keyboard shortcuts.
